Rice and Meat Stew Recipe

Servings: 4

Ingredients:

1 cup long-grain white rice
1 lb (450g) stewing beef, cubed
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 carrots, diced
2 potatoes, diced
1 bell pepper, diced
1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
4 cups beef broth
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
Chopped fresh parsley for garnish
Instructions:

Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.

In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the cubed beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the beef from the pot and set aside.

In the same pot, add the chopped onion and garlic. Saut√© until fragrant and translucent, about 2-3 minutes.

Add the diced carrots, potatoes, and bell pepper to the pot. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Return the browned beef to the pot. Pour in the diced tomatoes and beef broth. Stir in the paprika and dried thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the beef is tender and the vegetables are cooked through.

Meanwhile, cook the rice according to package instructions.

Serve the rice in bowls, ladle the meat stew over the rice, and garnish with chopped fresh parsley. Enjoy your hearty rice and meat stew!
